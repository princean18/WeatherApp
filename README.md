2. **Weather Data Display (OpenWeatherMap API)**:
   - The app uses the **OpenWeatherMap API** to retrieve weather data based on the coordinates obtained from the LocationIQ API.
   - The data includes temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other weather-related information for the chosen location.

3. **User Interface**:
